# bachelor-degree-thesis
This is my bachelor degree thesis written in italian. I took part in an internship with <a href="http://gamificationlab.uniroma1.it/" target="_blank">GamificationLab</a>, a Sapienza laboratory that deals with the design and development of web applications. I worked mainly on the development of new APIs for a smart parking application called GeneroCity.
